            <p>
                <span style="font-size:40px; color: red;">H</span>ey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself. I am Sumona Ferdous. I am from Pirojpur the district of southern-western part of Bangladesh. I am a student of Depertment of Computer Science and Enginerring(CSE) at Sonargaon University. I am studying at the best University in my city. I feel happy to be a part of this great University with the good friends, helpful and loving teacher and sound administration. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.. I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, to write; to think and to dream. I like to see the sunrise in the morning and to see the moonlight at night. I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote "Les Miserable", or like Roman Roland who wrote "John Christopher". They have influenced millions of people through their books. I also wanted to be a great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read peopleâ€™s mind. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some teaching, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive. This is a brief introduction of myself. If you are interested in knowing more, take a look at my facebook page. Do not expect too much, and keep your sense of humor.

                    "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
